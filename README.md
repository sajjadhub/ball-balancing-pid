# ball-balancing-pid
Ball balancing using a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller is a control system technique used to stabilize a ball on a beam. The system adjusts the beam's angle to maintain the ball at a desired position. Sensors measure the ball's position, and the PID controller calculates corrections by minimizing the error (difference between desired and actual position). The proportional term adjusts based on error, the integral term accounts for accumulated past errors, and the derivative term predicts future error trends, ensuring precise and stable balancing.
